## Project description

Memory Box is a sound journey about loss, grief, and acceptance, made by Tonia Zhang, Sashank Silwal, and Usman Ali.
The main character is a father who recently lost his son. Together with his wife, they are learning to accept the reality of what happened and move on.

The sound journey consists of three parts:
1) a short dialogue between MC (main character) and his wife, where his wife tells him to move their son's stuff to the basement. MC accidentally drops the box, and we can see what's inside.
2) After the box with the belongings are displayed, the user can click on three items (car, ball, pills) in order to hear the memories associated with each. 
3) After the three items are interacted with, they are put into the box, and the family picture is revealed, and here comes the last part of the sound jouney - the dialogue between MC and his wife, where they decide to accept the tragedy and move on. We are back to the reality.

The website was designed in a minimalistic style in order to make the user focus on the sound, and the main theme - the memory box. 

Credits: Sashank basically made the website + edited the footstep audio part, Tonia designed all the visuals + three memory sounds (car, ball, pills) and picked bgms, Usman edited the last part of the sound journey, added animation to the website, and handled MC's voice recordings. 


## Process

We started with our voice recordings and sticking the sounds together in order to make all the audio pieces. The first part - the footsteps - consist of background vacuum sound (the wife is vacuuming), footsteps, sound of dropping the box, the short dialogue between wife (Tonia) and MC (Usman). 
The second part involving three objects was hard in a sense that we didn't have a voice actor for the child, so we used random child laughter sounds from freesound.com and youtube videos of father and son playing soccer. It also included the past interactions between the child and the father and the child (football, car) and the mother (pill). Every piece is enveloped in a slightly sad background music to convey that those moments are from the past, and it is something you can never return to. To highlight this concept, we designed the sound piece in a way that doesn't allow the player to replay each memory. They are put in the memory box, and "khalas". It becomes the past. 

By the way, all the bgms are from the game "life is strange". The game is amazing despite of the low budget that was put into its creation. 

## Reflection

Overall, we are satidfied with the result, as it met our expectations. The website is consistent with the theme of the audio. Parts that need improvement: the "feel" of the audio (the footsteps and the interactions could seem more "real"), the smoothness of he UX. 
We don't think we need fancy animation, because it shifts the focus away from the audio's self-sustainability, might add to the visual pollution and also not meet the expectations. 
Thanks for reading!
